# Weather-now



## Description
There's no point during the day when we are not concerned about weather conditions. Whether we are travelling, deciding on a fun outdoor activity, or simply want to know how to dress for the day. Weather effects our daily lives and creating an application that is both useful and current is an extremely important tool to have as a Web Developer.  
The reason I wanted to build this application was to further my understanding of API addresses and create an application that will always stay current. 
Using an applicaton like 'Weather Now' will help anyone who needs to quickly know the weather conditions of any city in the world.
I learned how to call API addresses using Javascript. I also spent many hours debugging and troubleshooting my applicatoin.

The user can open my application by deploying it from the gitHub page. Once open the user can type in their desired city in the seacrh bar and press search. This will render the city's curent temp, forecast, humidity, wind speed, and uv index. 

## Usage
A user can use my application anytime they need to know the weather in their current location.
